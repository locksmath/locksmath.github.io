        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <p>Q: How do I take the final exam?<br>A: At the time of your appointment, you'll enter a video chat
        with a proctor, who will go over the instructions with you. When you are ready, the proctor will show
        you the exam questions. You do all your work sitting in front of a webcam, while the proctor watches,
        to verify that you aren't receiving any outside help. The maximum time is two hours. When you finish
        the exam, it will be sent to your instructor for grading. You should get an email within a few days,
        telling you whether you passed.</p>
        <p>Q: If I don't pass the final exam, can I take it again?<br>Q: Yes. Contact the ALOA Education Office
        to schedule another appointment.</p>
        <p>Q: What if I missed a few classes?<br>A: You may make up for what you missed by watching the video
        record of those classes. You may have received a link and password for the recordings, in your email.
        If you did not receive the link, or if you need it sent again, contact the ALOA Education Office.</p>
        <p>Q: How do I know if I completed all the quizzes and homework?<br>A: At the end of the course, you
        should receive an email from your instructor, listing the assignments you have not completed (if any).</p>
        <p>Q: What if I didn't pass one of the quizzes?<br>A: You may take any of the quizzes as many times
        as you like, until you obtain a passing score.</p>
        <p>Q: What if I passed all the quizzes but some of my scores didn't get submitted?<br>A: Take a screen
        shot of your quiz score(s) and email it to your instructor.</p>
        <p>Q: What's the deadline for completing all the homework?<br>A: There is no specific deadline, but it
        would be wise to submit all your homework within two to four weeks, while the lessons are still fresh
        in your mind.</p>
        <p>Q: What's if some of my homework was marked as "please resubmit"?<br>A: If your homework contains a
        significant mistake, your instructor may ask you to correct it and resubmit. Your instructor may decide
        that your work overall is sufficient to consider it as "completed". You should receive an email at the
        end of the course, informing you what assignments are incomplete (if any). If you did  not receive an
        email, of if you would like an update, please email your instructor.</p>
        <p>Q: I emailed my instructor and got no response.<br>Q: Your instructor may have a long "to-do" list.
        Please be patient. If it's been more than five days, it's possible that your email was misplaced or
        that your instructor is unavailable. Contact the ALOA Education Office.</p>
