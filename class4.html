        <p>It is possible to progress multiple pages by hand but, in most cases, you will progress multiple page
        systems with computer support. Learn the methods to tame the computer and make it progress the way you
        want, and shortcuts to make progressing by hand almost as fast as progressing with a computer.</p>

    <div id="lower">
        The quiz is multiple choice. When you click on your answer, it will immediately turn green (if you chose
        correctly), or red (if you chose incorrectly). At the end, you will get a score, and have the
        option to take the quiz again. There is no limit to how many times you can take the quiz. The score
        resets each time. Passing score is 70%. If you pass, you will have the option to submit your score
        to the instructor. If your score is 100%, you get a gold star.

        <!--<li>Write a KBA with <code>315842</code> as the TMK, with one constant, using two-step progression. Choose for yourself where to put the constants. Choose your own sequence of progression.</li>
        <li>Write a lead sheet showing all sixteen page masters. Leave room for incidental master keys, between the groups of four.</li>
        <li>Find the incidental masters which cover each group of four pages; write them on your lead sheet.</li>
        <li>Mark all the MACS violations.</li>
        <li>On a second piece of paper, draw a key schematic for a three-level system with two master keys AA and AB under grand master A, with six change keys under each master.</li>
        <li>Choose page masters for AA and AB. Write the key symbols AA and AB on the lead sheet, next to the bittings picked.</li>
        <li>Fully progress the AA page. Write in the key symbols for AA1 to AA6.</li>
        <li>Fully progress the AB page. Write in the key symbols for AB1 to AB6.</li>
        <li>Choose a key bitting for SKD1 and SKD2.</li>
        <li>Choose a key bitting for A1, a change key directly under the grand master.</li>-->
        <p>Each student will receive two TMK bittings to use for this exercise. These instructions are also attached to the email,
        along with a key schematic and some blank forms you may use if you wish.</p> 
        <ol>
        <li>Create a summary sheet for a 16 page system using one of your TMKs. You may use the form, Excel, plain paper, etc.</li>
        <li>Assign the master keys based on the schematic provided.</li>
        <li>Progress page 5 and use at least 25 bittings on that page.</li>
        <li>If possible, document an elevation or two on your summary sheet. If not possible, write “No elevations possible.”</li>
        <li>Turn in a summary sheet and page 5 for at least one system. For other systems, the summary sheet is sufficient.</li>
        <li>Bonus exercises- add changes under the grand, SKD changes, and an independent system BB.</li>
        <li>Be prepared to discuss TMK selection issues next week.</li>
