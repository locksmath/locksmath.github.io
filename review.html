        <h3>Preparing for the Final Exam</h3>
        <p>Before you take the final exam, you must do each of the following:<br>
            <ol><li>Attend all the classes.</li>
            <li>Pass all the quizzes.</li>
            <li>Complete all the homework.</li></ol></p>
            <p>You should receive an email when you have completed steps 1-3, informing you that you are eligible
            to take the exam. At that point, you should contact the ALOA Education Office to schedule an appointment
            to take the final exam.<code> education@aloa.org </code>The exam is in two parts, multiple choice and
            written exercises, taken on different days. At the time of your appointment, you'll enter a video chat
            with a proctor, who will go over the instructions with you. When you are ready, the proctor
            will show you the exam questions. You do all your work sitting in front of a webcam, while the proctor
            watches, to verify that you aren't receiving any outside help. The maximum time is two hours. When you
            finish the exam, it will be sent to your instructor for grading. You should get an email within a few
            days, telling you whether you passed.
            </p>

        <strong>This quiz is 35 questions -- quite a bit longer than the other quizzes. Many of the questions
        require a significant amount of thought before choosing an answer.</strong>When you click on your answer, it
        will immediately turn green (if you chose correctly), or red (if you chose incorrectly). At the end, you will
        get a score, and have the option to take the quiz again. There is no limit to how many times you can take the
        quiz. The score resets each time. Passing score is 70%. If you pass, you will have the option to submit your
        score to the instructor, but this is not a requirement. This review is for your benefit only, to help you
        prepare for the bigger questions which you will see on the final exam.
