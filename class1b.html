        <p>Simply put, Master Keying is the art of making two different keys operate the same lock. Typically, one
        is the <strong>change key</strong> and the other is the <strong>master key</strong>. We say the lock is
        <strong>master keyed</strong>. Alternatively, locks which are intended to operate with just one key are
        called <strong>single keyed</strong>, abbreviated <strong>SKD</strong>. In rare cases, you might want to
        make more than one change key operate the same lock, which is called <strong>cross keying</strong>. An
        extreme example of this is <strong>maison keying</strong>, where the goal is to make the lock operate with
        every change key from the entire building. (The word <em>maison</em> in French means <em>house</em>.)
        Locksmiths sometimes get confused by the term “cross keying”, thinking it means a mistake. That's not the
        case. Cross keying is something you do on purpose. When it happens accidentally, that's called <strong>key
        interchange</strong>.</p>
        <p>The most common method for master keying pin-tumbler locks is called <strong>split pin master keying</strong>,
        which involves putting an extra pin (called a <strong>master pin</strong>) between the bottom pin and driver
        pin. In rare cases, master pins may be stacked on top of each other, or the chamber might be left empty.
        Putting master pins in more than one chamber almost always enables additional <strong>incidental</strong> keys
        to operate. We often take advantage of this to create <strong>incidental master keys</strong> in a <strong>
        three-level</strong> master key system (change key, master key, <strong>grand master key</strong>). A lock
        which is pinned to the change key and the grand master key will automatically operate with the incidental
        master key. Incidental keys work because every cut on the key is identical to a corresponding cut on one of
        the operating keys for that lock. For example, suppose the grand master key A is <code>345612</code> and the
        change key AB6 is <code>363452</code>. Notice that both keys start with a <code>3</code> and end with a
        <code>2</code>. Positions like that, where the change key is identical to the top master key, are called
        <strong>constants</strong>. Constants are good. Constants are your friends. Now, consider a key cut to 
        <code>345452</code>. The first half of the key is identical to the grand master key and the second half is
        identical to the change key. Such a key would operate the lock, whether we want it to or not. We can take
        advantage of this and use <code>345452</code> as the AB incidental master key. Unfortunately, the existence
        of incidental keys greatly increases the chances for key interchange, which is why
        <a href="https://webstore.ansi.org/Standards/BHMA/ANSIBHMAA156282018">ANSI/BHMA &nbsp; A156.28</a> (the
        industry standard for master keying) specifies that locksmiths should minimize the incidental keys, <em>“by
        using the fewest possible master pins per cylinder”</em>. In other words, use as many constants as possible,
        to reduce the likelihood of key interchange.</p>
        <p>There are essentially three types of key interchange. First, a random key from outside the master key
        system might operate one of the locks because it is identical to one of the change keys, or a master key,
        or one of the incidental keys. Second, a key from inside the system might operate a lock (where it wasn't
        intended to) because it is identical to the change key for that lock, or a master key, or an incidental key.
        Third, the lock might be manipulated by a key that wouldn't be expected to operate that lock but sometimes
        turns anyway. Manipulation is often called “key picking”. Using a bump key is another example of manipulation.
        Locks are generally not intended to operate with a key cut to <code>999999</code>, but (sometimes) it turns.
        Key interchange by random outside keys, or by manipulation, is impossible to avoid entirely. But master
        keying tends to make it worse and steps should be taken to minimize the risks. Key interchange by keys inside
        the system is unacceptable and must be eliminated. A properly designed master key system should have no
        internal key interchange.</p>

        The quiz is multiple choice. When you click on your answer, it will immediately turn green (if you chose
        correctly), or red (if you chose incorrectly). At the end, you will get a score, and have the
        option to take the quiz again. There is no limit to how many times you can take the quiz. The score
        resets each time. Passing score is 70%. If you pass, you will have the option to submit your score
        to the instructor. If your score is 100%, you get a gold star.
