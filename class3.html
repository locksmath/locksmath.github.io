        <p>Progression from the KBA is one of the most fundamental skills in master keying-- and the one most
        commonly done incorrectly. Learn the correct way to progress pages from a Key Bitting Array, by hand or with
        master keying software. Learn to find and use incidental master keys and implement your key system plan.</p>
        <p>Click below if you want to view a presentation which covers Progression from the KBA. If you have already
        attended the Progression from the KBA webinar, you may not need to view the presentation; it's basically
        the same topics. You could skip down to the quiz.</p>

        The quiz is multiple choice. When you click on your answer, it will immediately turn green (if you chose
        correctly), or red (if you chose incorrectly). At the end, you will get a score, and have the
        option to take the quiz again. There is no limit to how many times you can take the quiz. The score
        resets each time. Passing score is 70%. If you pass, you will have the option to submit your score
        to the instructor. If your score is 100%, you get a gold star.

        <ol>
        <li>Write a KBA with <code>315842</code> as the TMK, with three constants, using two-step progression. Choose for yourself where to put the constants. Choose your own sequence of progression.</li>
        <li>Progress your KBA into a page of 64 key bittings, in standard progression format. Leave room for incidental master keys, between the blocks.</li>
        <li>Find all the block masters and vertical group masters; write them on your page.</li>
        <li>Mark all the MACS violations.</li>
        <li>On a second piece of paper, draw a key schematic for a three-level system with two master keys AA and AB under grand master A, with three change keys under each master.</li>
        <li>On your progressed page, choose appropriate incidental master keys for AA and AB. Write the key symbols AA and AB next to the incidental masters you picked.</li>
        <li>On your progressed page, choose appropriate change key bittings for AA1, AA2, AA3, AB1, AB2, and AB3. Write the key symbols next to the keys you picked.</li>
