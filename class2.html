        correctly), or red (if you chose incorrectly). At the end, you will get a score, and have the
        option to take the quiz again. There is no limit to how many times you can take the quiz. The score
        resets each time. Passing score is 70%. If you pass, you will have the option to submit your score
        to the instructor. If your score is 100%, you get a gold star.
